# About Erin Omyer

![Picture taken in Seattle, WA](smiley.jpg)

* Non-Statistical Question: How many hours does it take for an actor/actress to memorize their lines?
* Roughly six months after graduation, I would love to have a job with an organization that I am happy to work for, which allow myself to start a pathway into my future. Five years beyond graduation, I would hope I would be experiencing a life that is continuously enjoy. Whether that involve new friends, places, work experience, etc. 
* I hope my greatest career accomplishment would be a career where I am continuously looking forward to what I am applying in the organization. The greatest career won't be making the most amount of money, but ensuring that I am content with my career and life that follows.
* In Introduction to Data Science, I hope to learn the basic functions of coding in R. This will allow myself to expand further into other programming languages and accomplish cooperative communication. 
* Lastly, an interest fact about myself is that my right ear is smaller than my left ear, so I would be called "nemo" when I was little.
