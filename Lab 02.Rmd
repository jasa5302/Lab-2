* I would like to know what the difference in Educated voters, versus non-Educated voters within the US is, and how that fluctuates depending on where the voters live, as well as how much access they have to voting? 

* Six months after graduating, I hope to have gained a full time position as a Data Statistician for a compnay. (Preferrably Arrow Electronics). Five Years after that, I hope to have gained enough insight and support to have transitioned into a leadership role within my team, then later within my division of whatever company I will be a part of. 

* My greatest career accomplishment will be creating more evenly accessible platforms of data collection for varrying envrionments and communities where interpretation is clear.

* Given these hopes and goals, I want to learn and understand the several ways we, as individuals process data and then interpret/communicate that information to other entities. 

*Fun Fact: I have 2 Siblings, an older sister who is 21  and a younger brother who is 11. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
